# garytations
Makes it easy to type in the MyTime annotations Gary wants

This extension adds an additional text box underneath the comment box when entering your hours on mytime. 
This textbox is a text suggestion engine that will suggest the correct annotation so Gary can easily find what hours you worked for what.
In addition, when you set the comment via the Garytation box it will also default the type to 'Hours Worked' so you don't have to select that.
There's also a little bit of magic sometimes to brighten up your day ;)

The enter key will now select the first suggestion automatically and has improved styling!
